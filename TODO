1. Approximate query matching (potentially use soundex and/or expose another search URL)
2. Detect if input file is sorted and sort of not sorted (eliminates the -s switch)
3. Show upper bound on time saved if input file were sorted (in case of unsorted input file)
4. Update project URL on website, blog post, -h screen, etc...
