1. Approximate query matching (potentially use soundex and/or expose another search URL)
2. mmap() the input file into memory so that we need not read the snippets in
3. Detect if input file is sorted and sort of not sorted (eliminates the -s switch)
4. Show upper bound on time saved if input file were sorted (in case of unsorted input file)
5. Update project URL on website, blog post, -h screen, etc...
